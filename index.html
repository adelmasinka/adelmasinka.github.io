<p style="color:LightPink;">"I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship" Louisa May Alcott</p>
<p>Landslide - Fleetwood Mac</p>
I took my love, I took it down<br>
Climbed a mountain and I turned around<br>
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills<br>
'Til the landslide brought me down<br>
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?<br>
Can the child within my heart rise above?<br>
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?<br>
Can I handle the seasons of my life?<br>
Mm<br>
Well, I've been 'fraid of changin'<br>
'Cause I've built my life around you<br>
But time makes you bolder<br>
Even children get older<br>
And I'm gettin' older, too<br>
Well, I've been 'fraid of changin'<br>
'Cause I've built my life around you<br>
But time makes you bolder<br>
Even children get older<br>
And I'm gettin' older, too<br>
Oh, I'm gettin' older, too<br>
Ah, take my love, take it down<br>
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around<br>
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills<br>
Well, the landslide will bring it down<br>
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills<br>
Well, the landslide will bring it down<br>
Oh, the landslide will bring it down<br>
